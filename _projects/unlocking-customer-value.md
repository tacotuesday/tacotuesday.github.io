## The Problem

In our case study, Summit Outfitters, a fictional premium outdoor gear company, has recently secured investment to expand its market presence. The CEO tasks the data team with two critical questions:

1. Who are our most valuable customers?
2. Where are our cross-selling and up-selling opportunities?

## Investigation

As the sole data analyst on this project, I dove into the customer data using advanced analytics techniques to uncover hidden patterns. Here's a glimpse into my process:

### 1. Data Exploration and Cleaning

I started by thoroughly examining the customer data, cleaning it, and deriving new features to gain deeper insights.

### 2. Identifying Most Valuable Customers

I employed various clustering algorithms to segment the customer base, including DBSCAN, Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering, and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). GMM proved the most effective for this dataset.

## Solution

My analysis revealed that the most valuable customers in this scenario share these characteristics:

- Age: 30-55 years old
- Annual income: $158,000-$186,000
- Total spend: $7,552-$9,226
- Purchase frequency: 3-8 times per year

### 3. Uncovering Cross-Selling and Up-Selling Opportunities

I identified several customer segments ripe for targeted marketing efforts:

- High spenders with low purchase frequency: Prime for cross-selling complementary products
- Frequent buyers with lower total spend: Ideal for upselling to premium products
- Long-term customers with consistent spending: Perfect for exclusive offers and early access to new products

## Results

Based on my findings, I developed the following strategies:

1. Tailored marketing campaigns for the 30-55 age group
2. Development of premium products and VIP experiences
3. Implementation of a loyalty program rewarding long-term, high-value customers
4. Concierge customer service for top-tier customers
